# 2022-PngToRec-and-mapmaker2
2 tools. Png2Rec transforms a png file into a list of rectangles of each color. Mapmaker2 plugin for Roblox Studio then uses the rectangles to create a 3D map in Roblox.

PngToRec uses multiple processes running in parallel, while Mapmaker2 uses multiple processes running sequentially.
